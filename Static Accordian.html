      <div class="panel">
        <p class="Description">
          You can view your orders and manage them through “Manage Order” inside
          Seller Central (you will have access to sellercentral.amazon.in after
          your complete registration). If you are using Fulfilment by Amazon,
          your orders will be fulfilled and shipped by Amazon. If you are using
          Easy Ship, you can pack your orders and schedule pickup for our team
          through your Seller Central account. If you choose to store and
          deliver your products on your own, you need to pack and ship products
          to customers and then confirm to the customer about the shipment
          through your Seller Central account.

      <button class="accordion">How do I list my products on Amazon.in?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="Description">
          You can use our Web-based interface to list products one at a time, or
          excel-based inventory files to list your products in bulk. The
          procedure and information required will vary depending on whether your
          products are already in the Amazon.in catalogue. Once you complete
          your registration for selling on Amazon, you will be guided on the
          steps needed to list your products. Learn more about the listing
          process here. Please note that currently it is mandatory to have
          ISBN/bar codes to list on Amazon. If you are a manufacturer or do not
          have these, you can request for an exception by contacting seller
          support through your Seller Central account. Some product categories
          might require additional information to list your products

      <button class="accordion">What products can I sell on Amazon.in?</button>

          Baby Products, Batteries, Beauty, Books, Consumables, Consumer
          Electronics (including Cameras and Video Games - Consoles), Digital

      <button class="accordion">Are there requirements for my category?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="Description">
          If you have products to list in bulk, it is advisable to choose the
          Bulk listing option to add your products on Amazon.in. You can upload
          products in bulk for both - a new product ASIN created on Amazon.in or
          an already existing ASIN on Amazon.in. You can use inventory file
          templates to list your products in Amazon.in. You can create a
          template to suit your specific requirements and list different types
          of products across multiple categories using one custom template.

        Can customers leave feedback and why is customer feedback important?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="Description">
          Yes. Customers can leave feedback. Maintaining a high feedback rating
          is a critical factor for success on Amazon.in. It's the best way for
          customers to identify you as a trustworthy seller. Your rating appears
          on the Offer Listing Page and is one of the first things that
          customers see. In other marketplaces, we have observed that customers
          are more likely to purchase products from sellers with higher ratings.
          Your feedback rating is a key metric used by Amazon.in to measure your
          performance.
